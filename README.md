# Clustering and Classification with R

Welcome to the **Clustering and Classification with R** repository! This project is designed to explore and implement various clustering and classification techniques using the R programming language. It is part of a learning journey through Coursera’s "Clustering and Classification with R" course.

## Learning Objectives

1. **Clustering and Classification**  
   Understand the key concepts of clustering and classification in machine learning.

2. **R and R Studio Setup**  
   Install R and R Studio, and get comfortable with the interface.

3. **Data Import and Management**  
   Learn to import data into R from CSV, Excel files, Google Sheets, HTML tables, and databases.

4. **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**  
   Utilize the `dplyr` package for data manipulation and `ggplot2` for visualizations. Understand correlation tests and summarization techniques.

5. **Machine Learning Overview**  
   Explore the differences between traditional statistical methods and machine learning, and gain foundational knowledge of both.

6. **Clustering Algorithms**  
   Learn and implement clustering techniques such as K-Means, DBSCAN, and Fuzzy K-Means. Evaluate their performance and determine the best approach for your data.

7. **Dimensionality Reduction**  
   Apply methods like PCA, SVD, and Multidimensional Scaling to simplify datasets while retaining essential information.

8. **Feature Selection**  
   Identify key predictors using LASSO regression, FSelector, and Boruta analysis to enhance model performance.

9. **Supervised Learning**  
   Delve into classification techniques such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, and SVM. Evaluate model accuracy and variable importance.

10. **Advanced Clustering**  
    Explore Fuzzy C-Means clustering for more refined clustering analysis.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [R](https://cran.r-project.org/)
- [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/)

Ensure you have R and RStudio installed. You can install the necessary packages via:

```R
install.packages(c("dplyr", "ggplot2", "FSelector", "Boruta", "factoextra", "cluster"))
```

### Data

This project makes use of various datasets to demonstrate the techniques listed above. Data is either simulated or sourced from publicly available datasets.

### Installing

To clone the repository and get started:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Jencheng1/ClusteringClassificationR.git
cd ClusteringClassificationR
```
